## Hi there 👋

I am a versatilist and easily adapt to different hats (Full Stack Web Developer 🌐, App Developer 📱, ML Engineer 🤖 or beginner level Designer 🎨) depending on what the project requires. I love exploring new tech stack 💻 and leveraging them to build cool stuffs 🛠️.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Flutter, Next.js, Firebase, Supabase
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Generative AI
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with mastering multi-agent orchestration frameworks like CrewAI or AutoGen.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I build apps by day and debug my dreams by night.
